## I have included Web Scraping from Tabular Data Projects using Python in this Repository.

### About Web Scraping from Tabular Data:
Web scraping from tabular data refers to the process of extracting structured, organized information presented in tabular format from web pages. Tabular data is often arranged in rows and columns, resembling a table. Web scraping from table data typically includes steps like selecting the relevant rows and columns, and extracting the information for further analysis or storage. This can be done using programming languages like Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup and selenium.
